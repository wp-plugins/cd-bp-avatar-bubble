== Description ==

After moving your mouse pointer on a BuddyPress user avatar you will see a bubble with the defined by admin information about this user. 

Ajax calls save your bandwidth and time spent on waiting. So if you want your users can easily get information about themselves on a fly - use CD BP Avatar Bubble.
